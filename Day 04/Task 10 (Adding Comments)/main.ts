//Task 10 (Adding Comments)

//QUESTION:10

//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one 
//comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs
// are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of 
//each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
